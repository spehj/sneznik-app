# Sneznik Castle Digital Guide App

This is a Flutter app for tours around Sneznik Castle (Slovenia, Europe). Right now visitors can only be guided through castle with a guide.

Purpose of this app is that tourists would be able to take a tour around the castle at their own pace.

App is designed like a CMS, so people from the museum could edit/add/delete content as they wish. This way no manual update of the app is needed.

App uses Firebase NoSql storage for content and Firebase Storage for images.

## Demo of the app
A quick tour through the app to get the idea.


App is still work in progress.
